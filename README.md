# parallel-rsp

A implementation of the N64 RSP for emulators. Used in Mupen64Plus and in Parallel emulators, this version is a Zilmar-spec plugin, which means its made for Project64 or other Zilmar plugin based emulators.

To build it, install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and its Toolchain package (pacman -S mingw-w64-toolchain) then run build_win.sh to build it for your OS.

Make sure to always build both x86 and x64 versions depending on which architecture of the emulator you're running.
